        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya who is often referred by his initials MV, was India’s first Civil Engineer, Statesman, and the 19th Diwan of Mysore who served the position from 1912 to 1918. The birth anniversary of  Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya on September 15 is celebrated as Engineers Day in India to honour and acknowledge his work for the development of the country. Notably, Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya was the Chief Engineer of Krishna Raja Sagara Dam in the North-West suburb of Mysuru City and also worked as the Chief engineer of the flood protection system for Hyderabad.</p>

            <h1>National Engineers Day: History</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engineers Day is celebrated in different parts of the world on different days. In India, this day is celebrated on 15th September every year. The history of National Engineers Day can be traced back to 1968, when it was first celebrated on Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya’s birth anniversary. Since then, the day has been celebrated every year.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya passed away in 1962, but left a rich legacy of developing innovative engineering technology behind. Here are some of the historical contributions of Sir MV that are remembered on National Engineers Day.</p>
            <h1>Engineers Day: Contributions of Sir MV</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir MV’s engineering and irrigation techniques were used to manage floods.
                In 1903, Sir MV designed and developed automatic floodgates, which were installed at the Khadakwasla reservoir, Pune.
                Sometime later, these automatic floodgates were also installed at the Krishnaraja Sagara in Mysuru and the Tigra Dam in Gwalior. Sir MV was the chief engineer in both of these projects.
                In 1908, he contributed to controlling the Musi river floods in Hyderabad by developing modern sewage systems.
                He contributed to the design of the road that links Tirumala and Tirupati.
                In 1917, Sir MV formed the Government Engineering College in Bengaluru, which was later renamed the University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering.
                He received an Honorary Membership from the London Institution of Civil Engineers.</p>
            <h1>National Engineers Day: Significance</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engineers Day reminds us of the importance of designs and structures that make our world smooth and functional. Here are some of the most regarded engineers from India who are remembered on National Engineers Day for their contributions</p>

            <p>The full form of CSE is Computer Science Engineering. It is an engineering course that involves several computer science aspects essential for the creation of the computer system. It is a four-year undergraduate engineering course wherein students study computer software & hardware for theoretical & practical knowledge.The CSE course covers computational-related subjects such as programming languages, algorithm analysis, software, device hardware & programme design. Computer science was previously considered as part of the departments of mathematics or engineering, but now it has become a different field of engineering.</p>

            <p>The full form of ECE is Electronics and Communication Engineering. ECE is an engineering branch that includes the production, design, research and testing of electronic devices and technology issues related to telecommunications systems, electronics, computers and related industrial sectors. ECE is introduced at the UG and PG standard by several colleges and universities in India, referring to B.Tech and M.Tech degrees, respectively.ECE engineers are developing all of the electronic devices in the world. ECE typically involves activities such as designing, constructing and maintaining satellites to offer telephone, television and internet access to remote and rural areas; constructing modern networking services such as video conferencing that connect users around the world</p>

            <p>Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It is considered the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering, and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering.Civil engineering can take place in the public sector from municipal public works departments through to federal government agencies, and in the private sector from locally based firms to global Fortune 500 companies.</p>

            <p>Mechanical engineering is the study of physical machines that may involve force and movement. It is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science, to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems. It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering branches.Mechanical engineering requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, design, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others.</p>
