        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya who is often referred by his initials MV, was India’s first Civil Engineer, Statesman, and the 19th Diwan of Mysore who served the position from 1912 to 1918. The birth anniversary of  Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya on September 15 is celebrated as Engineers Day in India to honour and acknowledge his work for the development of the country. Notably, Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya was the Chief Engineer of Krishna Raja Sagara Dam in the North-West suburb of Mysuru City and also worked as the Chief engineer of the flood protection system for Hyderabad.</p>

        <h1>National Engineers Day: History</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engineers Day is celebrated in different parts of the world on different days. In India, this day is celebrated on 15th September every year. The history of National Engineers Day can be traced back to 1968, when it was first celebrated on Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya’s birth anniversary. Since then, the day has been celebrated every year.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya passed away in 1962, but left a rich legacy of developing innovative engineering technology behind. Here are some of the historical contributions of Sir MV that are remembered on National Engineers Day.</p>
        <h1>Engineers Day: Contributions of Sir MV</h1>            
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir MV’s engineering and irrigation techniques were used to manage floods.
                In 1903, Sir MV designed and developed automatic floodgates, which were installed at the Khadakwasla reservoir, Pune.
                Sometime later, these automatic floodgates were also installed at the Krishnaraja Sagara in Mysuru and the Tigra Dam in Gwalior. Sir MV was the chief engineer in both of these projects.
                In 1908, he contributed to controlling the Musi river floods in Hyderabad by developing modern sewage systems.
                He contributed to the design of the road that links Tirumala and Tirupati.
                In 1917, Sir MV formed the Government Engineering College in Bengaluru, which was later renamed the University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering.
                He received an Honorary Membership from the London Institution of Civil Engineers.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mechanical engineering is the study of physical machines that may involve force and movement. It is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science, to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems. It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering branches.Mechanical engineering requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, design, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others.</p>
